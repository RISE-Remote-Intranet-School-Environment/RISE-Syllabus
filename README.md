## GETTING STARTED
This is a springboot project. \
Use intellij in order to use java and maven. \
In MYSQL Workbench, import the dump folder located in /Assets/dumpsylla/ .  \

When you have succesfully imported the db and cloned the repository, you simple have to run SyllaApplication located in src/main/java/com/RISE/sylla/SyllaApplication.java with inteliji.

You can test that the application is running properly by trying with postman. 
For example, http://localhost:8081/user/users
